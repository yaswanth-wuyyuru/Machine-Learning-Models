Skillset Employed: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyPlot, scikit-learn (sklearn), Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine Learning

üìã Project Description:

This project utilizes Simple Linear Regression to analyze the relationship between vehicle Engine Size and CO‚ÇÇ Emissions. Using a dataset of vehicle specifications, we explore how changes in engine size and other vehicle features influence CO‚ÇÇ emissions. The analysis leverages scikit-learn for building the regression model and Matplotlib for visualizing relationships.

Project Outcomes:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed the dataset's structure and calculated summary statistics for features like engine size, cylinders, and fuel consumption.
Ensured data quality through checks for null values and performed data cleaning where necessary.
Data Visualization:
Visualized relationships between different vehicle features and CO‚ÇÇ Emissions using scatter plots:
Relationship between Engine Size and CO‚ÇÇ Emissions.
Impact of Fuel Consumption Combination on CO‚ÇÇ Emissions.
Relationship between Cylinders and CO‚ÇÇ Emissions.
Histograms were used to display the distribution of key features.
Data Modeling:
Built a Simple Linear Regression Model to predict CO‚ÇÇ Emissions based on Engine Size.
Used 80% of the dataset for training and 20% for testing, ensuring a robust evaluation of model performance.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluated model performance using key metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 22.63
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 854.93
R¬≤ Score: 0.79
The high R¬≤ score indicates that the model effectively captures the relationship between Engine Size and CO‚ÇÇ Emissions.
üìä Visualizations:

1. Scatter Plot: Engine Size vs. CO‚ÇÇ Emissions üîµ
This plot illustrates the positive linear relationship between Engine Size and CO‚ÇÇ Emissions.
As the Engine Size increases, the CO‚ÇÇ Emissions also tend to increase.
2. Scatter Plot: Fuel Consumption Combination vs. CO‚ÇÇ Emissions üî¥
Shows the impact of combined fuel consumption on CO‚ÇÇ Emissions.
Higher fuel consumption generally leads to higher CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
3. Scatter Plot: Cylinders vs. CO‚ÇÇ Emissions üü¢
Explores how the number of cylinders affects CO‚ÇÇ Emissions.
Vehicles with more cylinders tend to produce higher CO‚ÇÇ Emissions.
4. Train Data Distribution üü£
Visualizes the distribution of training data points for Engine Size and CO‚ÇÇ Emissions.
The linear trend is highlighted with a regression line.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used:

Python: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
Matplotlib & PyPlot: Visualization of data relationships.
