Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

Objective:
To detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a machine learning-based classification approach. The goal was to develop and evaluate models that can identify fraud from normal transactions with high accuracy, precision, and recall.

Project Overview:
This project focused on building machine learning models for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used contained a high class imbalance between fraud (minority) and normal transactions (majority). You employed various techniques to preprocess the data, handle imbalance, and build multiple models to compare their performance.

Key Contributions:
Data Preprocessing:
Handled duplicates: Detected and removed 1,081 duplicate records from the dataset, reducing it to 283,726 rows.
Standardization: Applied StandardScaler to normalize features such as Time and Amount for uniformity, aiding in model convergence.
Feature Scaling: Ensured all features were on the same scale by standardizing numerical values.
Class Imbalance Handling:
Undersampling: Addressed the imbalance by undersampling the majority class (normal transactions) to match the number of fraud cases.
Oversampling using SMOTE: Employed Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class (fraud transactions), ensuring the model was trained with an equal number of fraud and normal transactions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed a correlation analysis and visualized the relationships between features using a heatmap.
Visualized the distribution of fraud and normal transactions using a count plot to highlight the class imbalance.
Model Development:
Trained and compared three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
Evaluated the models using metrics like Accuracy Score, ROC-AUC Score, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.
Results on Imbalanced Data:
Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 99.91% and an ROC-AUC score of 0.776.
Decision Tree Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 99.91% and an ROC-AUC score of 0.879.
Random Forest Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 99.95% and an ROC-AUC score of 0.866.
Results after Addressing Class Imbalance (SMOTE):
Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 94.51%, and a well-balanced ROC-AUC score of 0.945.
Decision Tree Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 99.81% with an ROC-AUC score of 0.998.
Random Forest Classifier: Achieved an outstanding accuracy of 99.99% and an ROC-AUC score of 0.999.
Model Deployment:
Model Saving and Loading: Successfully saved the best performing model using joblib for future predictions, ensuring reusability.
Implemented a Random Forest Classifier model for real-time fraud detection based on trained features, with a prediction function to classify new transactions.
Exceptional Achievements:
Demonstrated the ability to handle highly imbalanced data effectively using both undersampling and oversampling techniques.
Successfully optimized and evaluated multiple models, achieving near-perfect precision and recall in detecting fraudulent transactions after oversampling.
Incorporated a thorough approach to model evaluation using detailed metrics, ensuring that the model performance was not just high in accuracy but also in recall and precision for the minority class (fraud).
Automated the model deployment process, enabling real-time fraud detection using the trained model.
